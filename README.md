# Web Development Tools and Resources

Tools I use to make development efficient and fun and iterative:

- [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com)
- [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com)
- [normalize.css](http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) - I use this if I'm not using Bootstrap, which is rarely for client sites and usually only when I'm working on personal projects. It's already integrated into Bootstrap so you don't have to use it if you already have Bootstrap. Basically makes all browsers behave as similar as possible, getting rid of weird default settings.
- [Holder](https://github.com/imsky/holder) - Really nice placeholder image tool.
- [Base theme](https://github.com/kmcgillivray/base-theme) - I made this Jekyll theme to get started on Jekyll sites faster. It's extremely simple, but includes all the basic set up that I would have to do every time I start a site, but with out all the clutter of the default theme that comes with Jekyll.
- [typography.css](https://github.com/kmcgillivray/typography.css) - I use this set of typography CSS on basically every site as a starting point and tweak it for the specific site I'm using it on. It's already included in the Base Theme. It includes nice spacing between headings, paragraphs, lists, etc., nice and simple font scaling styles for responsiveness, readable line lengths and font sizes, etc.
- [Typekit](http://typekit.com) - Included in our Creative Cloud membership. No more boring fonts. Easy to sync fonts to your computer and use them on websites.
- [Font Awesome Icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/icons/) - Easy to use set of icons, including social media icons.

Text Editors:

- [TextMate](http://macromates.com) - This is my main text editor. It's comfortable, does cool things, simple.
- [Sublime Text](http://sublimetext.com) - I've been trying this one out more. It's very popular. You can buy a license but really you can use it for free too.
- [Atom](http://macromates.com) - A newer editor from Github.

For Wordpress or Statamic:

- [MAMP](http://www.mamp.info) - For creating a local development environment for Wordpress and Statamic. I run php/database driven sites from my `/sites` folder which requires a change in the MAMP settings.

For deployment/version control:

- [Github](http://github.com) - For when it doesn't matter if the site is public and you want to collaborate with as many people as you want. We each have access to our individual accounts and the group Insight account.
- [Bitbucket](http://bitbucket.org) - Like Github, but for when you want to have a private repository for free. I set up a group account for Insight just like on Github.
- [Git ftp](https://github.com/git-ftp/git-ftp) - So you never have to keep track of what's changed on a website and manually upload it to a server. Combines the command line, FTP, and git.
- [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com) - *I love Github Pages.* I use this for any of our internal web projects, our site is hosted on it. I also often use it for client sites in development that don't need PHP or a database. It automatically generates Jekyll sites.

People I follow/other resources:

- [@mdo](http://markdotto.com) - Mark Otto, creator of bootstrap, from Wisconsin!
- [Code Guide](http://codeguide.co) - Made by mdo, advice for consistency and readable HTML and CSS, especially for collaborators, but useful any time.
- [Hidden Files](http://ianlunn.co.uk/articles/quickly-showhide-hidden-files-mac-os-x-mavericks/) - Every so often I want to see the hidden files on my computer, usually when I'm working with the hidden `.git` folder and stuff like that. This article has a helpful alias you can set up to make toggling hidden files easy.

# Email Development Tools and Resources
